# Image Caption Generation using LSTM
## NLP Mini Project
The Image Caption Generator is an advanced artificial intelligence system designed to
generate descriptive, coherent captions for images. By combining cutting-edge computer
vision and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this system is capable of
understanding visual content and expressing it in textual form.

## Dataset Used
We have used Flickr8k dataset for training the LSTM Model

## Technologies and Tools used: 

Python as programming language

TensorFlow and Keras are used to build and train the neural network models.

CNNs are employed for image feature extraction.

LSTMs are used to generate captions word by word based on the features extracted from the image.
